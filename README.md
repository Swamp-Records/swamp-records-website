## Swamp Records Website

Swamp Records is a Gainesville-based, student-run artist resource agency at the University of Florida. We provide marketing, PR, advertising, and booking services to musicians and bands across North Central Florida, while offering hands-on experience to students pursuing careers in the music industry.

We're passionate about empowering the Florida music scene by organizing concerts, festivals, and creative events. Our mission is to spotlight local art, music, and culture by collaborating with Gainesville's businesses, nonprofits, and artists to grow and enrich the community.

We're a collective of creatives, organizers, taste-makers, and friends working to uplift Gainesville.
